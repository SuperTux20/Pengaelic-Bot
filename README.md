# PengaelicBot
A simple multi-purpose Discord bot.
Current functions are as follows...
- Responses like Dad Bot ("Hi hungry, I'm the Pengaelic Bot!")
- Automatic message deletion based on a text file of keywords
- Roll some dice!
- Say hi or bye
- Repeat what you say

Plans for the future:
- Make different functions toggleable
- Option to change prefix
- Ability to alter the message filter file
- More game functions (drawing cards, flipping coins, etc.)
