# Pengaelic Bot
### A simple multi-purpose Discord bot.
Current functions are as follows...
- Responses like Dad Bot ("Hi hungry, I'm the Pengaelic Bot!")
- Automatic message deletion based on a text file of keywords
- Roll some dice, draw cards, flip coins...
- Pop bubblewrap! ||pop||
- Magic 8 Ball
- Mostly-functioning options
- Alterable "rudeness level", 0 is the least rude and 3 is the current maximum

Plans for the future:
- Make the ability for options to be different in every server
- Option to change prefix
- Ability to alter the message filter file
-
